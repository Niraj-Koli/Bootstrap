                    known as the Hero of the Hidden Leaf. He soon proved to be

                    isolates him from others, leading him to be branded as an
                    international criminal. After learning the truth of his
                    brother's sacrifice, later proving instrumental in ending
                    the Fourth Shinobi World War, and being happily redeemed by
                    Naruto, Sasuke decides to return to Konoha and dedicate his
                    life to help protect the village and its inhabitants,
                    becoming referred to as the "Supporting Kage".

                    Naruto Uzumaki is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uzumaki clan.
                    He became the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails on the day of his
                    birth — a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of
                    Konoha throughout his childhood. After joining Team Kakashi,
                    Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all
                    the while chasing his dream to become Hokage. In the
                    following years, through many hardships and ordeals, he
                    became a capable ninja regarded as a hero both by the
                    villagers, and soon after, the rest of the world, becoming
                    known as the Hero of the Hidden Leaf. He soon proved to be
                    one of the main factors in winning the Fourth Shinobi World
                    War, leading him to achieve his dream and become the
                    village's Seventh Hokage.

                <div class="card-body text-center">
                    Gaara is a shinobi of Sunagakure. He was made the jinchūriki
                    of the One-Tailed Shukaku before he was born, causing the
                    villagers of Suna to fear him as a monster. With nobody to
                    connect to, Gaara grew up hating the world and looking out
                    only for himself, giving his life meaning by killing anyone
                    he came across. After being defeated by Naruto Uzumaki — a
                    jinchūriki like himself who found strength in his
                    friendships — Gaara starts emulating him. He becomes Suna's
                    Fifth Kazekage so that he can protect the village and all
                    those who live there, dispelling the fears he cast on the
                    villagers.

                    Itachi Uchiha was a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan
                    who served as an Anbu Captain. He later became an
                    international criminal after murdering his entire clan,
                    sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke. He afterwards
                    joined the international criminal organisation known as
                    Akatsuki, whose activity brought him into frequent conflict
                    with Konoha and its ninja — including Sasuke who sought to
                    avenge their clan by killing Itachi. Following his death,
                    Itachi's motives were revealed to be more complicated than
                    they seemed and that his actions were only ever in the
                    interest of his brother and village, making him remain a
                    loyal shinobi of Konohagakure to the very end.
